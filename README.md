# Recommendation System - TMBD Dataset

## Introduction
A recommendation system is a technology that suggests products, services, or information to users based on data analysis. This project explores the implementation of various types of recommendation systems to suggest movies based on user preferences and behavior.

## Real-Life Recommendation Systems
- **Netflix's Recommendation Engine**: Suggests movies and TV shows based on the user's viewing history and preferences.
- **Amazon’s Product Recommendation System**: Recommends products based on browsing and purchase history.
- **Spotify’s Music Discovery Features**: Curates playlists tailored to individual musical tastes.

## Types of Recommendation Systems
1. **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommendations based on the collective preferences of users.
   - **User-based**: Based on similarities between users.
   - **Item-based**: Based on similarities between items.
2. **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends items similar to those a user has previously liked.
3. **Hybrid Systems**: Combines collaborative and content-based methods.
